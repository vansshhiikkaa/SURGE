## Project:
Applications of Stochastic Differential Equations in Mathematical Finance
## Mentor: 
Prof. Mrinmay Biswas, Department of Mathematics & Statistics, IIT Kanpur
## Objective: 
To comprehensively understand Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) & their applications in modelling dynamic systems influenced by random fluctuations like Financial Market, Weather Patterns, Epidemics & Spread of Diseases, etc
## Approach:
• Explored the concepts of probability spaces, random variables & stochastic processes to establish the basis of SDEs
• Investigated numerical approximation schemes, Euler’s scheme, for solving SDEs & approximating their solutions
• Applied SDEs in finance, focusing on modelling stock prices, to enhance risk assessment & investment decision-making
## Impact:
• Developed proficiency in mathematical modelling & analysis of stochastic processes, enabling the accurate approximations
• Demonstrated practical applications of SDEs, contributing to more informed risk assessment in stock market analysis
